# LiBoard - Python
A Python module for using LiBoard on a computer.
It can handle the connection to the board, detecting played moves and connecting to the Lichess Board API.

This repo also contains some scripts for common use cases (playing with the Lichess Board API, saving OTB games as a PGN).
Run the scripts with the `--help` option to see information about their arguments.
